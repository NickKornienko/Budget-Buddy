# Budget Buddy

Created by: Brian Liu, Edwin Wong, Brandon Bazile, Magdalena Ramirez, and Nick Kornienko
 
This app was created to help individuals create interactive and visual budgets. Users begin by creating a new account or signing in to a current account. They can create different budgets, add different items to each budget that qualify at expenses or income and visualize the entire budget in a bar or pie graph. 

#Installation & Use

1. This app uses py4web, bulma, and vue.js. Please make sure you have these installed.
2. Clone the git repo into the apps folder of the main py4web folder.
3. Using your terminal navigate to the py4web and run apps using the command: ./py4web.py run apps
4. In your browser (google chrome or firefox work best) visit the apps login page.
5. Create an account if you have not already and begin creating budgets.
