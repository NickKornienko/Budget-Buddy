# Budget Buddy

Created by: Brian Liu, Edwin Wong, Brandon Bazile, Magdalena Ramirez, and Nick Kornienko
 
This app was created to help individuals create interactive and visual budgets. Users begin by creating a new account or signing in to a current account. They can create different budgets, add different items to each budget that qualify at expenses or income and visualize the entire budget in a bar or pie graph. 

# Installation & Use

1. Clone the [git repo](https://github.com/web2py/py4web) into the apps folder of the main py4web folder.
2. This app uses py4web, bulma, and vue.js. Please make sure you have these installed.
3. Once you have cloned the git repo, make sure to install all the packages in `requirements.txt` by running `pip install -4 requirements.txt`
4. Using your terminal navigate to the py4web folder and run apps using the command: `./py4web.py run apps` on windows you may need to use: `python py4web.py run apps'
5. In your browser (google chrome or firefox work best) visit the apps login page.
